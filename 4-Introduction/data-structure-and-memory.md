## Static Memory Allocation
Is the memory allocated on the Stack by the program (code), the number of bytes allocated for each variable. The size is decided on compile time and each size for each variable type depends on compiler, operational system, hardware etc.
Stack Memory is an oranized memory, works like a stack, stacking allocated memory for each function.

## Dynamic Memory Allocation
Is dinamic because uses the Heap Memory like a resource, alllocate when needed and freed when no longer needed. A program (code) can't access directly heap memory, can only be accessed by pointers, using the address for the allocated memory.
Heap Memory is an unorganized memory, does not have an order for allocation.
